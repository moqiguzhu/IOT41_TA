## Max Queue
- we know that we can implement a max/min stack with two normal stacks easily, and we can implement a queue with two stack easily. So, to implement a max queue, we can first implement a max stack with two normal stacks, and then implement a max queue with two max stacks.
- There is another kind of method which can be used to implement a max queue. For more detailed information, please refer to deng's books.
- Compared with deng's method, this kind of implementation is quite easy to understand. As for efficiency, both methods can complete pop and push operation in O(1) time(amortized meaning).
